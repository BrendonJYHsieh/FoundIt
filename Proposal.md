## Part 1: Target Audience & Problem Statement

### Target Audience
Columbia University students who lose or find items on campus. Students are our ideal users because they:
- Lose items frequently
- Can't afford replacements
- Are tech-savvy
- Form a trusted community through .edu verification

Starting with Columbia creates critical mass before expanding to other universities.

### Pain Points We're Addressing

#### 1. The current lost & found system is broken:
- **Physical lost & found offices** are scattered across campus (library, gym, dorms) with limited 9-5 hours
- **No way to search online** - you have to physically visit each location and dig through bins
- **Facebook groups are a mess** with hundreds of unorganized posts that get buried in minutes
- **Students expose personal information** publicly to strangers, which is dangerous for IDs and wallets
- **No verification system** means anyone can falsely claim your item

#### 2. The financial impact is brutal:
Replacing lost items can cost students hundreds or even thousands of dollars they can't afford:
- **Laptops**: $800–$2,000
- **Phones**: $200–$1,000
- **Textbooks**: $100–$300
- **IDs**: $25
- **Keys**: $50–$200

Most of these losses are unnecessary since the items are often found but never returned to their owners.

## Part 2: Our Solution - Core Features

### What Our SaaS Does to Address the Pain Points

#### 1. For people who lost something:
- **Post details**: item type, description, location, date, optional photo
- **Instant matching**: Our system immediately searches for matching found items
- **Smart notifications**: Get instant notifications when potential matches are found
- **Curated results**: Review 3-5 relevant suggestions instead of scrolling through hundreds of posts

#### 2. For people who found something:
- **Post proof**: Upload a photo proving you have the item
- **Add details**: Specify where and when you found it
- **Set verification questions**: "What color is the phone case?" "What's the sticker on the laptop?"
- **Smart suggestions**: System suggests people who might be the owner

#### 3. Smart matching & security:
- **Algorithm matching**: Automatically compares item type, location, date, and description
- **Verification gate**: Someone thinks they found your item? They must answer verification questions correctly first
- **Privacy protection**: No contact information shared until verification passes
- **Fraud prevention**: This prevents scammers and ensures the right person gets their stuff back

- **Trusted network**: .edu verification creates a trusted student-only network

## Part 4: Competitive Advantage & Market Differentiation

### Why Our SaaS is Unique/Different from Solutions in the Market

#### 1. vs. Physical Lost & Found:
- **24/7 availability** - not just weekday business hours
- **Online search and filter** instead of visiting multiple locations in person
- **Unified database** instead of scattered offices
- **Direct contact** with the actual person who found your item

#### 2. vs. Facebook Groups:
- **Structured posts** with categories instead of chaotic timeline
- **Proactive algorithm** actively finds matches instead of hoping someone sees your post
- **Private messaging** instead of exposed contact information
- **Verification system** instead of blind trust
- **Persistent posts** don't get buried after 5 minutes

#### 3. vs. Generic Lost & Found Apps (like LostIt, FoundItNow):
- **Columbia-verified students only** (safer than general public)
- **Campus-specific locations** everyone recognizes
- **University integration** with Columbia security and ID office

#### 4. What makes us special:
- **.edu verification** creates a trusted student-only network
- **Proactive matching** means the system finds your item for you
- **Verification questions** prevent theft and false claims before contact is made
- **Two-sided solution** helps both people who lost items and people trying to return them
