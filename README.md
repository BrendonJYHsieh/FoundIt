# FoundIt - Columbia's Lost & Found Platform

üîç **Lost something? We'll find it.** FoundIt is Columbia University's trusted lost & found platform that connects students who have lost items with those who have found them through smart matching and secure verification.

## Features

- **Secure Verification**: Question-based authentication prevents false claims and protects privacy
- **Columbia Integration**: .edu email validation and campus-specific locations
- **Reputation System**: Build your reputation as a trustworthy community member
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for on-the-go usage
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant alerts when potential matches are found

## Prerequisites

- Rails 8.0.3
- SQLite3
- Node.js (for asset compilation)

## Testing

### Running RSpec Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test files
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/models/lost_item_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/jobs/find_matches_job_spec.rb

# Run with detailed output
bundle exec rspec --format documentation

# Run tests with coverage
bundle exec rspec --format progress
```

### Running Cucumber Tests

```bash
# Run all Cucumber features
bundle exec cucumber

# Run specific feature files
bundle exec cucumber features/user_registration.feature
bundle exec cucumber features/lost_item_management.feature

### Key Models

- **User**: Columbia students with authentication and reputation
- **LostItem**: Items reported as lost with verification questions
- **FoundItem**: Items reported as found with photos
- **Match**: Algorithm-generated matches with similarity scores

### Background Jobs

- **FindMatchesJob**: Automatically finds potential matches when items are posted

### Database Schema

The application uses SQLite3 with the following main tables:
- `users` - Student accounts and profiles
- `lost_items` - Lost item reports
- `found_items` - Found item reports  
- `matches` - Algorithm-generated matches

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /signup` - User registration
- `POST /login` - User login
- `DELETE /logout` - User logout

### Items
- `GET /lost_items` - List user's lost items
- `POST /lost_items` - Create lost item
- `GET /found_items` - List user's found items
- `POST /found_items` - Create found item

### Matches
- `GET /matches` - List user's matches
- `PATCH /matches/:id/verify` - Verify match ownership

### Dashboard
- `GET /dashboard` - User dashboard with statistics
